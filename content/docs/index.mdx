# COMP 765 - Intelligent Robotics

### Overview

Robotics is the study of physical bodies that can perceive and act in the world, and for computer scientists, the focus is on the algorithms, data structures, models and math that makes a robot intelligent. Even with modern hardware, the real world can easily overwhelm a poor algorithm, so often efficient and scalable use of computation equals intelligence.

### Topic List

#### Problems

Navigation

Manipulation

Learning from Data

Interaction with Humans

#### Highlight Methods/Models

Bayesian Filtering

Optimal Control

Learning to Model Dynamics (aka “World Models” or “World Foundation Models”)

Model-based and Model-free RL for robotics problems

Imitation Learning including IRL

Active IL

Language-informed High-level Decision Making

Vision-Action-Language Models
